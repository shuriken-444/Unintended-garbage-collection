# Unintended-garbage-collection  

Humans are notorious litter bugs. There is a collossal amount of "interesting stuff" that is just left lying around servers scattered all across the internet and the world.  

>  - Are your SSH keys sat on some server somewhere in the Ukraine, China, Or elsewhere
>  - Are you backing up for the world to mirror?   
>  - Are your server logs with sensitive  information sat freely available to the world on a server in China  
>  -  Is your favourite TV show on a server free to download   
>  - Are your company accounts sat there for the world to see....
>  - Plus many more

Useful for alot of reasons

>  - Are you publishing info without knowing it
>  - OSINT Investigations
>  - Poor OPSEC

My intention was to find every "Index of /" server publically accessable, This generates alot of data. That's why there is a Torrent.
